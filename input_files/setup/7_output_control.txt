// Control what to output
// By default, we output the basic variables at every step to a file named flowfield.plt in the output folder, which is used to restart computation and visualize the flowfield.
// However, there may be some situations where we need a simple view to some of the planes, which are usually the boundary faces.
// Therefore, we tell which boundary faces to be output here, by specifying the related boundary condition label

// The faces which are related to this boundary condition label will be outputted
array  int output_bc   {
    // 2
}

// Settings about monitor points
// First, specify whether we would monitor the flowfield at some points.
// If we monitor, the choice would be 1, otherwise 0.
int if_monitor = 0

// If we monitor, specify the file that contains the monitor points
string monitor_file = input_files/setup/monitor_points.txt

// If we monitor, specify which variables to monitor
// The variables are specified by their names
array string monitor_var {
    density u   v    pressure temperature  H2
}
