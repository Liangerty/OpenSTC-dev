// Control what to output
// By default, we output the basic variables at every step to a file named flowfield.plt in the output folder, which is used to restart computation and visualize the flowfield.
// However, there may be some situations where we need a simple view to some of the planes, which are usually the boundary faces.
// Therefore, we tell which boundary faces to be output here, by specifying the related boundary condition label

// The faces which are related to this boundary condition label will be outputted
